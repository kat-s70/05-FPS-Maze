# Exercise-05d-Networked-Game

Exercise for MSCH-C220

A demonstration of this exercise is available at [https://youtu.be/QlKtFpAqYTw](https://youtu.be/QlKtFpAqYTw)

This exercise is a chance to play with Godot's networking capability in a 3D context. We will be extending a simple first-person-controlled character and allow the control of two of these characters over localhost.

Fork this repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-05d-Networked-Game. Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-S22 with your full name. Commit your changes.

Clone the repository to a Local Path on your computer.

Open Godot. Import the project.godot file and open the "Networked Game" project.

In res://Game.tscn, I have provided a starting place for the exercise: the scene contains a parent Spatial node (named Game) and a StaticBody Ground node (containing a MeshInstance Plane and a CollisionShape). There are two starting locations for the players and a light source. There is also a HUD control node (to show information about the player).

We are now going to make this a two-player experience (not really a game, yet).

First create a new scene. Make it a User Interface scene (Control) and change the name of the resulting node to Lobby. Add two buttons, Host and Join. Center them on the page, and update their labels to Host and Join (respectively). Add a Label and set its Layout to Full Rect. You can leave it blank, but center its text horizontally and vertically.

Attach the following script to the Lobby node (save it as `res://Lobby/Lobby.gd`):
```
extends Control

func _ready():
	var _connect = get_tree().connect("network_peer_connected", self, "_player_connected")


func _on_Host_pressed():
	var net = NetworkedMultiplayerENet.new()	# Set up networking
	net.create_server(13458, 4095)				# This Godot instance will host the game (i.e., be the server). It will connect on TCP/UDP port 13458, and it can host 4095 possible connections
	get_tree().set_network_peer(net)
	Global.which_player = 1						# The hosting instance will control player 1 
	$Label.text = "Hosting"
	$Host.hide()
	$Join.hide()

func _on_Join_pressed():
	var net = NetworkedMultiplayerENet.new()
	net.create_client("127.0.0.1", 13458)		# This Godot instance will join an existing game. 127.0.0.1 (localhost) means to connect to this computer on port 13458
	get_tree().set_network_peer(net)
	Global.which_player = 2						# Control player 2
	$Label.text = "Joining"
	$Host.hide()
	$Join.hide()

func _player_connected(id):						# When the connection has successfully been made, load the Game scene and hide the lobby
	Global.player2id = id
	var game = preload("res://Game.tscn").instance()
	get_tree().get_root().add_child(game)
	hide()

```

Then, attach signals to Host and Join and connect them to the preexisting functions in the Lobby script.

Save the scene as res://Lobby/Lobby.tscn, and then, in the Project menu, Project Settings->Application->Run, set the main scene to `res://Lobby/Lobby.tscn`

Next, edit `res://Game.gd` so that a second player is added:
```
extends Spatial

onready var player1pos = $Player1Pos								# the starting position for player 1
onready var player2pos = $Player2Pos								# starting position for player 2
onready var controlled = load("res://Player/Player.gd")				# the "active" player's script
onready var passive = load("res://Player/Player_passive.gd")		# the network-controlled player's sccript

func _ready():
	var player1 = preload("res://Player/Player.tscn").instance()	# instance player 1
	player1.name = "Player1"
	player1.set_network_master(get_tree().get_network_unique_id())	# Set up the ability for the player to communicate over the network
	player1.global_transform = player1pos.global_transform			# set the initial position
	player1.get_node("Mesh").get_surface_material(0).albedo_color = Color8(34,139,230)	# set player1's color to blue
	if Global.which_player == 1:									# If this window is hosting, control player 1
		player1.script = controlled
	else:
		player1.script = passive
	add_child(player1)												# Add player 1 to the game
	
	var player2 = preload("res://Player/Player.tscn").instance()
	player2.name = "Player2"
	player2.set_network_master(Global.player2id)
	player2.global_transform = player2pos.global_transform
	player2.get_node("Mesh").get_surface_material(0).albedo_color = Color8(250,82,82)	# set the color to red
	if Global.which_player == 2:
		player2.script = controlled
	else:
		player2.script = passive
	add_child(player2)

```

Finally, we need to create the passive script for the network-controlled player. Create a new script: `res://Player/Player_passive.gd:`
```
extends KinematicBody
		
remote func _set_position(pos):
	global_transform.origin = pos

remote func _set_rotation(rot):
	rotation.y = rot

remote func _die():
	queue_free()
```

Then, edit `res://Player/Player.gd` to send the remote procedure calls when the position or rotation is updated, or when the player dies:
```
	rpc_unreliable("_set_position", global_transform.origin)
```
```
	rpc_unreliable("_set_rotation", rotation.y)
```
```
	rpc_unreliable("_die")
```

Test your project. You will need to bring up two instances of the same project in Godot and run both of them. In one window, select "Host". In the other, select "Join". You should be able to move between the two windows and see the two players updated as they move around.

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, add a summary message, commit your changes and push them back to GitHub. If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-05d-Networked-Game) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing the "Created by" information with your name):
```
# Exercise-05d-Networked-Game

Exercise for MSCH-C220

A simple networked game

To play, load two copies of this exercise in Godot. Run one and press the Host Game button. Then load the second copy and press the Join Game button. The position of the players will be relayed over the network (over localhost) from one copy to the other. Each player can be controlled (using WASD) depending on which window is selected.

## Implementation

Built using Godot 3.4.2
